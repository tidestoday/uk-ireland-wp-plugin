**Widget usage**

Simply drag and drop the widget into the sidebar through the WordPress dashboard. Set the properties using the fields and save.

**Shortcode usage**

The shortcode accepts the following parameters:
* days - the number of days to show tide data for (max 3, default 3)
* title - the title to show above the tide times (default 'Tide times')
* map - whether or not to show a map. (true or false, default true)
* location - the location slug to show times for (default 'llandudno', see the list of locations further down)

You can add content to the shortcode to display a description:

`[tide_times days=1 map=true title="Tide times for Conwy" location="conwy"]These are today's tides for Conwy[/tide_times]`

or without content:

`[tide_times days=1 map=true title="Tide times for Conwy" location="conwy"]`
